# grading_system

A software system that will help an Instructor enter their course marking. The software
system will read as input from the console for each student their student number (char array), the lab
grade (float), the quiz grade (float), the midterm grade (float), and the final exam grade (float). Each
grade is a percentage out of 100, with the lab worth 40% of the course, the quiz 10%, the midterm 20% and
the final exam 30%.
